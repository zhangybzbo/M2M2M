I am at my happiest when I am in a smoke-filled , crowded bar with the riffraff of savages I call my friends , our voices raised , our faces flushed , our speech slurred , as we strumble from one poorly constructed argument to the next half-baked bagful of lies -LRB- to quote Michael Jackson -RRB- .
