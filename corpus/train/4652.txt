Instead of this set of Grub Street authors , the mere canaille of letters , this corporation of Mendicity , this ragged regiment of genius suing at the corners of streets in forma pauperis , give me the gentleman and scholar , with a good house over his head and a handsome table ` with wine of Attic taste ' to ask his friends to , and where want and sorrow never come .
