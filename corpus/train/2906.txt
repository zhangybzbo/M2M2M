Those of you who ran free , I hoped to hunt you down , to set a pack of hounds of Heaven or Hell , whichever was my fate , upon a great rangale of red deer , or my own hand with longbow or crossbow to pierce the heart of a wild boar , and then sit at ttable and tear your sweet flesh with my hands and eat .
