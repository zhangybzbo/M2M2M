It was formerly known as How Park , possibly through the early connexion of William de Ow with the parish , and had its origin in the charter of 1200 granting William Briwere the elder chase of hare , fox , cat and wolf through all the king 's land -LRB- per totam terram nostram -RRB- and warren of hares , pheasants and partridges throughout all his own lands , as also licence to inclose two coppices , one of which was situated between King 's Somborne and Stockbridge and the other was called How Wood .
